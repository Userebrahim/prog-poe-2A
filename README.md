my poe prog 6221 PROG 2A ( PART 1 - 3) 2023
Reflection

In this final poe ive improved on my project to display the output much more clearly
Ive created a more user friendly IU and have fixed my scaling implementation. The calorie count is now more accurate and will display the calorie count on the recipe , the recipes are no longer stored in array listing either.
There is a clear usage of how to create a recipe
The recipe listing is saved to create a recipe listing to which you can view multiple recipes at a time
It can also filter properly without crashing. It meets the basic requirements.
